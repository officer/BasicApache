- name: "Web Server | Place files"
  copy:
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html # required. Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to. If I(src) is a directory, this must be a directory too. If I(dest) is a nonexistent path and if either I(dest) ends with "/" or I(src) is a directory, I(dest) is created. If I(src) and I(dest) are files, the parent directory of I(dest) isn't created: the task fails if it doesn't already exist.
    src: index.html # not required. Local path to a file to copy to the remote server; can be absolute or relative. If path is a directory, it is copied recursively. In this case, if path ends with "/", only inside contents of that directory are copied to destination. Otherwise, if it does not end with "/", the directory itself with all contents is copied. This behavior is similar to Rsync.
    remote_src: no # not required. If C(no), it will search for I(src) at originating/master machine.,If C(yes) it will go to the remote/target machine for the I(src). Default is C(no).,Currently I(remote_src) does not support recursive copying.,I(remote_src) only works with C(mode=preserve) as of version 2.6.
    mode: 0444 # not required. Mode the file or directory should be. For those used to I(/usr/bin/chmod) remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like C(0644) or C(01777)) or quote it (like C('644') or C('1777')) so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.  Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.  As of version 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, C(u+rwx) or C(u=rw,g=r,o=r)).  As of version 2.3, the mode may also be the special string C(preserve).  C(preserve) means that the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.
    owner: apache # not required. Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to I(chown).
  become: yes
